Changing the default font to your Minimal Mistakes (MM) website is extremely easy. Just follow the steps outlined below. 

## Step 1 - Choose a font you want to use
To start, you will need to find a `.ttf` or `.otf` file of your chosen font. 

Here are a couple neat websites: 
1. [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/) - Large selection of general purpose fonts
2. [CTAN Mirror](https://mirrors.rit.edu/CTAN/fonts/) - LaTeX-based fonts

For the following steps, I chose to use the [**Computer Modern Sans-serif Roman**](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/computer-modern?q%5Bterm%5D=Computer+Modern&q%5Bsearch_check%5D=Y) font. 
## Step 2 - Decide how you will store your font 
### Option 1 - Store the font in your MM build
By storing your chosen font within your website, depending on your website's traffic, fonts will load significantly faster. 

For this example I chose to download and store the font within my MM build at `assets/fonts/cmunss.ttf`
### Option 2 - Grab an online link to the .ttf or .otf file
This option bypasses having to store your font in your MM build, but may result in slower webpage loading times. 

Instead of downloading the font, you can equivalently paste the following link from the CTAN website in step 3: [http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm-unicode/fonts/otf/cmunss.otf](http://mirrors.ctan.org/fonts/cm-unicode/fonts/otf/cmunss.otf)

## Step 3 - Modify custom.html
Locate and open the `custom.html` file in your Minimal Mistakes folder, usually located under `_includes/head/custom.html`. Insert the following code snippit. 


```html
<head>
    <style>
        @font-face {
            font-family: "Computer Modern Sans";
            src: url("/assets/fonts/cmunss.ttf") format('truetype');
            font-weight: sans-serif;
            font-style: normal;
        }

        body {
            font-family: "Computer Modern Sans", sans-serif;
        }
    </style>
</head>
```

**Note** The `url` entry changes depending on if you chose option 1 or 2 for step 2.

## Step 4 - Modify _variables.scss
Lastly, we need to tell MM to use the newly implemented font. Open `_sass/minimal-mistakes/_varaibles.scss`. 

[@mmistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes) has a good [discussion](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/discussions/1352) on what to change in this file. But as another example, the changed lines in ``_varaibles.scss`` that were made to this website are shown below: 

```scss
/* system typefaces */
$sans-serif: 'Computer Modern Sans', sans-serif !default;
$sans-serif-narrow: 'Computer Modern Sans', sans-serif !default;

$global-font-family: 'Computer Modern Sans', sans-serif !default;
$header-font-family: 'Computer Modern Sans', sans-serif !default;
$caption-font-family: 'Computer Modern Sans', sans-serif !default;
```
## Step 5 - Save and refresh your changes 
All done! Build your website and enjoy your new font!
