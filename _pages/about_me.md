Thanks for visiting! Currently, I'm a second year PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder and a member of the [Nonequillibrium Gas and Plasma Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/ngpdl/) under Prof. Iain Boyd. My research involves the simulation of high-speed compressible flows where thermochemical effects are no longer negligible.

Previously, I graduated from The University of Michigan with my BSE in Aerospace Engineering with a focus in external aerodynamic analysis and aircraft design. There, I worked within Prof. Jesse Capecelatro's [Multiphase/Multi-Physics Flow Laboratory](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jcaps/) studying the particle flow physics of pulsatile coughs and expulsions. I was also strongly involved with my student design team, [M-Fly](https://mfly.engin.umich.edu/) where I helped design large-scale RC aircraft for the national SAE aero competition. 

I try to get outside whenever I get the chance - take a look [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/gallery.md %}) for some fun photos I've taken.
